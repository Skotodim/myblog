Firebase Jekyll Blog
=========================

There should be a description here but since I don't know what to write [this](https://github.com/mimming/firebase-jekyll-comments) github repo has many useful things with better explanations.

### TODO List

1. Finish the comment section on post pages and add some folder for the js files.
2. Set up the travis:ci for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and delete the _site directory.
3. Actually update the README.md file
